Befunge uses reverse polish notation, therefore we write whatever numbers we want to multiply,
and then we write the operator. We need to multiply 2 user inputs, which in befunge, uses the ampersand.
Therefore, the befunge code is as follows:
**&&*.@** 
where we take 2 user inputs, multiply them, pop the value from the stack using the period,
and ending the program using the at symbol.

After we write the code we need to **nc 104.236.80.67 5677** from terminal.
We input our code and get the following message returned.
