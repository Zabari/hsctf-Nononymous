The key to getting this one right is knowing that the accumulator resets if it equal 256.
We're told Keith has iiss fish in other words (1 + 1) * (1 + 1) * ((1 + 1) * (1 + 1)) = 16
                                    or simply    2    *   2     *     4               = 16

1) so the first letter is s --> 16 * 16 = 256 so the accumulator now equals 0
2) the we use i, now the accumulator equals 1
3) i again the accumulator equals 2
4) s the accumulator equals 4
5) i the accumulator equals 5
6) then o to print out the answer.
