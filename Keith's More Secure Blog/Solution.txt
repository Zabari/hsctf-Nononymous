We want to be able to log in, and there is a nice page that will give us the password. However,
we are unable to view it with any browser, even if it's non-gui, such as wget or curl, or even using python's
urllib. As a result, we need to spoof our user agent and make it blank. Now, we can get the password and log in.
The command I used was:

    curl -H "User-Agent:" http://104.236.80.67/KeithsMoreSecureBlog/passwordhere.php
