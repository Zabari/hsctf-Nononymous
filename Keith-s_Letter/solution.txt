They told you the first letter was h, and you know that letters represent different letters due to the fact that words like aa exist.
Put it in decipher mode, and start with a.  I guessed that the first words were hello keith, and quickly realized the whole text was contained in the cipher.
Due to the offset, the next letter of the text appeared before the next letter of the cipher, so you continue typing in the text letter by letter and you get the whole text.
